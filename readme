Thanks for taking a look at this treasure hunt game! 

Objective
Navigate the board to find the treasure. 

Included:
1. *new* Click button to start game 
2. Prompt to enter user name
3. Set user location at bottom left corner
4. *new* Hide treasure in random location 
5. Prompt to enter direction and perform checks:
  - Alert user if invalid entry
  - *new* Alert user if move is off board
6. Update location and prompt for new move until user finds treasure
7. *new* When found, congratulate user and reset game to start over 

Of note:
- *Known issue* - User starting location and treasure location can match at the start of the game, but shouldn't because the 'win' isn't detected
- *Spoiler alert* - Console will tell you where the treasure is! I instrumented write to console for name, user location, and treasure location at each loop to log behavior. If you want to avoid the spoiler, then don't open console :).
